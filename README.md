# OBJECT DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING 

## A. PROJECT SUMMARY

**Project Title:** OBJECT DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING

**Team Members:** 
- MD SHADMAN ZOHA
- Nafish Ahammed
- ISRAT JAHAN
- Israt Jahan Bhuiyan


 **Objectives:**
- To build a system that can guess the name of an object from film or real-time footage. 



##  B. ABSTRACT 

Object detection is the method of detecting real-world object instances in still images or videos, such as a vehicle, bike, TV, flowers, and people. It helps us to recognize, localize, and detect different objects within an image, allowing us to have a greater understanding of the image as a whole. It is widely used in image retrieval, protection, surveillance, and a variety of other applications.

Object detection can be accomplished in a variety of ways:

- Detection of Objects Using Features
- Object Detection SVM Classifications with HOG Features by Viola Jones
- Object Detection Using Deep Learning
